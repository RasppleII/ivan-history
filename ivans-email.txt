Subject: Building the distro
Message-Id: <>

Hi Joseph,

Building the distro was not something I ever prepared for a theoretical 
external developer, so it's not very general cased. With that said, I tried to 
make my own life easy, so it's moderately optimized. I'm doing this from 
memory rather than having the device in front of me, but I think the process 
is:

(Install and boot a fresh Raspbian.)
cd /tmp
wget ivanx.com/rasppleii/history-setup.txt
source history_setup.txt

This replaces ~/.bash_history with a downloaded one.

So then, you use up-arrow all the way back to the top command, then proceed 
through each command in order, which are visibly numbered.

You will notice that step 2 is biased towards US keyboard and Eastern time. 
I'm geocentric, what can I say.

You don't need to execute step 0. If you're not using NOOBS, you can skip steps 1, 7, and 8, and instead just shut down and write the blocks to a raw image using dd or Pi Copier.

If you're making a NOOBS distro, then before you execute steps 7 and 8, you 
need to insert a FAT-formatted 4GB+ USB stick into the Pi. This will receive 
the NOOBS tarballs. They need to be compressed using xzip, which takes all day 
and all night on the Pi, so my workflow is to sneakernet the uncompressed 
tarball to my Mac to do the compression.

After step 8, put the USB stick in your Mac. This is very hardcoded to my 
setup, but should be easily adapted. Here's what's specific for my 
environment:

- The USB stick volume name is "4GB"

- In my home directory is a folder called Raspbian

- In the Raspbian folder is a folder called "RasppleII-xxx" where xxx is the 
intended version number, and it contains all the NOOBS files for Raspple II. 
I never go into this folder in the Finder so I don't get .DS_Store files and 
the linke. I can't remember whether this folder can contain a virgin NOOBS, 
or whether it needs to be an existing Raspple II distro. I always use the 
last distro.

- Once I'm set, I paste the following into Terminal. It will leave 
RasppleII-xxx.zip in my ~/Raspbian folder, and also begin uploading it to my 
server (authenticated by public/private keypair, so that I can just so this 
and come back four hours later.)

echo -n "Raspple II version: "; read; rasppleVersion=$REPLY; [[ ! -d ~/Raspbian/RasppleII-$rasppleVersion ]] && echo "~/Raspbian/RasppleII-$rasppleVersion not found." || { cd ~/Raspbian/RasppleII-$rasppleVersion; sed -i '' "17s@:.*@: $(( $( echo $(( $(ls -sk /Volumes/4GB/ROOT.TAR | cut -f 1 -d ' ') * 1024 )) | rev | cut -c 7- | rev ) + 1 ))@" os/Raspbian/partitions.json; echo "Copying..."; cp /Volumes/4GB/BOOT.TAR /tmp; cp /Volumes/4GB/ROOT.TAR /tmp; echo "Starting compression..."; xz -c -9 -e /tmp/BOOT.TAR > os/Raspbian/boot.tar.xz; xz -c -9 -e /tmp/ROOT.TAR > os/Raspbian/root.tar.xz; zip -0r ../RasppleII-$rasppleVersion.zip *; echo "Uploading..."; scp ../RasppleII-$rasppleVersion.zip liveb3@ivanx.com:www/ivanx/appleii/rasppleii/files/; }


The process is exactly the same for the Virtualbox VM; it gets a different 
bash_history that omits all the NOOBS-specific stuff. When it's done, I shut 
it down and export an OVA file for distribution. Before I export the OVA, I 
make sure the virtual Ethernet interface has MAC address 08:00:03:F2:FF:59, so 
that there's a known MAC someone can setup a DHCP reservation in their router 
for.


I think that's it. Hope this helps.


Best,
Ivan.
